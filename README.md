This project a working repository that was used during a hackathon. The project consisted of a leveled plane for golf that could represent an unevenness of the ground while playing on a simulator.
- Arduino code for controlling electric motors connected to a leveled plane.
- Python script that calculates an angle based on Unity's representation of a surface in JSON
- Autodesk Inventor models of parts used for building the plane
